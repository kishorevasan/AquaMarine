## Introducing **Serve It**, a sustainable solution to a charitable ecosystem
#### Bringing Charitable Actions into Your Everyday Life
### Why? 
There are lot of homeless people who starve because of poverty and on the other hand there are lot of food wasted by people after having food from the restaurant --- The disparity between the fortunate and the less fortunate inspired us to think about ways to challenge the status quo in our society and create sustainable solutions to bring charitable actions into our daily life as well as introduce gradual mutual understanding between the two groups. 

That's why we created **Serve it**. 

### What?
**Serve it** is a number you can text to when you wish to donate to a homeless person face-to-face on the fly. It could be food, clothes, items or anything you wish to donate that you believe could make a difference to another person's life. We will match you to the closest homeless person, texts you route to get to him, and bring you to an anonymous SMS chat. 

### How?
Text "Hi" to (510) 756 2698 to receive a help message, which will help navigate you to the right places.
